# Bay Area Paragliding Sites
Someone asked recently who was the local weather guru or if there was a place to learn about the different weather quirks of different sites. I realized there wasn't a central place to allow the community to gather this info. Take a look, and send a pull request!

This information reflects my personal experience. Paragliding is dangerous. If what I say contradicts an instructor, your instructor is right.
